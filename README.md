# Countdown Timer

## Project Overview

The Countdown Timer is a web-based application that allows users to set a target date and time. Upon clicking the "Start" button, the application starts a countdown, displaying the remaining days, hours, minutes, and seconds until the target time is reached. Once the timer hits zero, the display shows "Time's up!" and animates in a blinking fashion.

## Features

- **Target Date & Time Input:** Users can specify the exact date and time for the countdown using a native HTML5 datetime-local input field.
- **Start Button:** The countdown starts when the user clicks the "Start" button.
- **Live Countdown Display:** The countdown dynamically updates every second, showing the remaining days, hours, minutes, and seconds.
- **Completion Animation:** When the countdown reaches zero, the display blinks to signal the completion of the countdown.
- **Responsive Design:** The application is fully responsive and adapts well to various screen sizes.
- **Animations:** Smooth fade-in animations for the countdown text and blinking effects when the countdown completes.
